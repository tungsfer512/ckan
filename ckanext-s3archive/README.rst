Description
===========

This extension archives all resource files stored in the local CKAN filestore into S3.  The files are removed locally and just hosted on s3. When a user requests these files they are redirected to a temporary S3 url for download.  Only authorized users are allowed to get these urls and the urls expire after 30 mins for security.

Installation
============

To install this package, from your CKAN virtualenv, run the following from your CKAN base folder (e.g. ``pyenv/``)::

  pip install -e git+https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-s3archive#egg=ckanext-s3archive

Then activate it by setting ``ckan.plugins = s3archive`` in your main ``ini``-file.

Compatability
=============

CKAN 2.2+

Configuration
=============

Config options should be placed in main section of the CKAN config file::

    ckanext.s3archive.access_key = <access_key>
    ckanext.s3archive.secret_key = <secret_key>
    ckanext.s3archive.bucket = <bucket>

    ckan.plugins = <current_plugins> s3archive


Usage
=====

The following paster command will archive all the files to S3

ckan-paster --plugin=ckanext-s3archive s3archive archive -c /etc/ckan/production.ini

This command can be put in a cron job and is safe to be run regularly but is recommended that it is run about once a day.  This is to give plenty time for the last job to finish before rerunning.  If doing a large migration then it is probably best to run the command outside the cron for the first run.
